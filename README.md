# Owltracker

This is a containerized REST API that can be used to track weekly metrics for someone tracking their progress using Duolingo. I built this minimal app to store and serve data as a replacement for some of Duolingo's own (defunct) API services. The API is built using FastAPI, with built in documentation for its routes at `/docs`.

<!-- ## Starting the API

I'm using `podman` to build/run container images. -->
